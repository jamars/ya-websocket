Yet Another WebSocket Experiment...
<h1>OH WHY?</h1>

Just for fun!

<h1>How to build<h1>

Be lazy.
Download and install Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition.
Run it...
Clone the repo.
Open the solution and build it!

<h2>So... What does it all mean?...</h2>

... Or, what does it do?

The solution has 3 projects.

- WebSocketServer. Deplorable code trying to implement a part of RFC 6455; it doesn't implement it all of course.
- WebSocketServer.Tests. Some tests I wrote, just because.
- ConsoleTestApp. Runs a simple server to serve as example of what one could do with this thing. It's obvious that you wouldn't go very far...

There's an html file (unimaginatively called example.html) that you can use to test the server from a browser.
I've tested it with Chrome and Firefox.

Thanks for your patience!
